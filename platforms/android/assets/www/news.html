                        <h5><strong>St. Albert RCMP is reminding all Drivers that even when mornings are rushed, all traffic laws must be obeyed.</strong></h5>
                        <h6>Common problems that the RCMP is seeing are:</h6>
                        <ul class="collection">
                            <li class="collection-item"><strong>Backing up unsafely or interfering with traffic</strong> – people pulling into residential driveways and backing out into traffic = $115 fine</li>
                            <li class="collection-item"><strong>Make U-turns in urban area between intersections</strong> – people dropping off their children and then pulling a U-turn to leave the area in the opposite direction = $115 fine</li>
                            <li class="collection-item"><strong>Stop or Park within 1.5 meters from driveway</strong> = $57 fine</li>
                            <li class="collection-item"><strong>Stop or Park where prohibited by traffic control device</strong> (signs) = $57 fine</li>
                            <li class="collection-item"><strong>Stop or park on roadway side of motor vehicle parked or stopped at curb or edge of roadway</strong> (double parking) = $57 fine</li>
                            <li class="collection-item"><strong>Stop or park within 5 meters of a fire hydrant</strong> = $57 fine</li>
                            <li class="collection-item"><strong>Stop or park within 5 meters of a marked crosswalk</strong> = $57 fine</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This all means drivers cannot stop or park next to small boulevards where they are too close to crosswalks, fire hydrants and driveways. <strong>Please plan your day to give you extra time to find legal parking areas and then walk your child to school.</strong></p>
                        <p>If the signs at the school indicate pickup or drop off, you are not to leave your vehicle. Your child gets out and walks to the school and you pull away.</p>
                        <p><strong>Simpler yet, <a href="http://www.spschools.org/transportation">send them on the school bus</a>. The goal is to get all students to and from school safely – no matter how rushed anyone is.</strong></p>

				        <h5><strong>Friday, October 14, 2016 from </strong>4:00 to 5:30 pm at dc3 Art Projects (10567 – 111 Street, Edmonton)</h5>
                        <p><strong>This event is part of MacEwan University’s Fine Art Program Visiting Artist Series 2016/2017 and is hosted by dc3 Art Projects.</strong></p>
                        <h6><strong>About the Work: Tranquility to Unease</strong></h6>
                        <p>Tammy Salzl makes tales in the form of paintings, drawings and immersive installations; taking us through the evolution of her painting practice and into her explorations with time based and sculptural mediums. Salzl uses familiar tropes of children’s stories and fairytales to tell contemporary fables that examine the emotional and psychological complexities of modern life. Combining found and created video, painting, sound environments and hand-worked constructions, Salzl’s work invites the viewer to wander through peaceful domestic settings where all is not as it initially seems. Tranquility gradually gives way to curiosity and unease.</p>
                        <h6><strong>About the Artist</strong></h6>
                        <p>Tammy Salzl is an Edmonton-born, Montreal-based artist who received her MFA in painting and drawing at Concordia University in 2014. Her work has shown widely across Canada, as well as in Germany and Mexico, and her newest installation was presented as a Featured Artist Project during Art Toronto 2015. Salzl is a Tedeschi Scholarship recipient and has received numerous grants and residencies.</p>
                        <h6><strong>Sponsored by Alberta Foundation for the Arts</strong></h6>
